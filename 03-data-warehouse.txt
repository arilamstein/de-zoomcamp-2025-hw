Question 1. 
20,332,093. See hw3-1.png

Question 2. 
0 MB for the External Table and 155.12 MB for the Materialized Table
See hw3-2-external.png and hw3-2-table.png

Question 3.
I'm guessing that it's this answer, because adding the second column (which 
is of the same type) exactly doubled the amount read. This answer seems most
consistent with that, which is I guess what you wanted us to realize:

"BigQuery is a columnar database, and it only scans the specific columns requested 
in the query. Querying two columns (PULocationID, DOLocationID) requires reading 
more data than querying one column (PULocationID), leading to a higher estimated 
number of bytes processed."

Question 4.
8,333. My query is:

SELECT 
  count(*)
FROM  
  `dtc-de-448517.hw3.all` 
WHERE
  fare_amount=0

Question 5.
Partition by tpep_dropoff_datetime and Cluster on VendorID. Same as
the video. The query is:

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE dtc-de-448517.hw3.all_partitoned_clustered
PARTITION BY DATE(tpep_pickup_datetime)
CLUSTER BY VendorID AS
SELECT * FROM dtc-de-448517.hw3.all;

Question 6.
310.24 MB for non-partitioned table and 26.84 MB for the partitioned table
See hw3-6.png for a screenshot of the estimate of the partitioned table.

Question 7.
GCP Bucket. That's what it means for the table to be external.

Question 8.
False. Why would it be? It seems only useful if you are frequently 
ordering it (essentially what the cluster does) and there's a lot of it
(so the cost of the the cluster in space and time is worth it)
